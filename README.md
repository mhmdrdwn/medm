Mining Academic Articles using RNN
==============================

Master Thesis

Final Notebooks are in the folder https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/

The folder contains:

1 - Four LSTM models notebooks for mention classfication. The models uses different BERT models for feature extraction

- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-classification-biobert.ipynb
- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-classification-umlsbert.ipynb
- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-classification-scibert.ipynb
- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-classification-coder.ipynb

The four models are using the identical methodologies except the use of the BERT model


2 - Two LSTM models notebooks for mention detection. The models uses different BERT models for feature extraction

- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-detect-scibert.ipynb
- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/mention-detection-coder.ipynb

The two models are using the identical methodologies except the use of the BERT model

3 - Nearest Neighbour Search

- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/nearest-neighbour-final.ipynb

4 - Visualization of the results of all the models 

- https://github.com/mhmdrdwn/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/final_work/ensembles-and-evaluations.ipynb
